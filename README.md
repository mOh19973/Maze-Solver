# Maze Solver
The project will include three different modes. Each mode will consist of defining the maze map in a different way. Each maze map contains a start point (S), an end point (E), and some obstacles.
In mode 1, the default mode, you will be provided with a pre-defined map. In mode 2, the obstacle mode, the user will be asked to enter only obstacles where S and E are pre-defined. In mode 3, the maze mode, the user will be asked to enter the start point S, the end point E, and a certain number of obstacles.
After each mode, the program will search for a solution of the maze grid or it will detect that there is no path (No solution
